# Known Issues

Developed since 2012, one of the biggest SA-1 Pack challenges is to deal with potential emulation issues, because of the chip complexity and the so little known, accurate information about the SA-1 system.

Along that, there is always some issues that is from the SA-1 Pack itself and needs to be corrected. This document will attempt to list some potential issues the patch will present on emulators as well on real consoles.

For consistency, only issues from latest version of each emulator will be listed, with rare exceptions.
